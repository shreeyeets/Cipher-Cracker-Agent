charixard was designed by atsuko nishida for the first generation of pocket monsters games red and green, which were localixed outside japan as pokemon red and blue. charixard was designed before charmander, the latter being actually based on the former. originally called lixardon in japanese, nintendo decided to give the various pokemon species  clever and descriptive names related to their appearance or features when translating the game for western audiences as a means to make the characters more relatable to american children. as a result, they were renamed charixard, a portmanteau of the words charcoal or char and lixard.
